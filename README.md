# repobackupper

A script to ensure my sanity. Allows you to download all repos to the local disk, for creating your backups, for safety. This allows you to store them on your USB hard drive, Dropbox, etc, as a reliable extra storage location.


# note (win10)

Windows usage of the script is unsupported by me, I don't use Windows. It probably won't work. I don't test it on Windows. See LICENSE for details.

It should require Windows 11 version 23H2 build 22635.4145 or later.

Required dependencies are: Git Bash (https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases), and Microsoft's modern 'Windows Terminal' (from the Microsoft Store)

# note (linux)

Linux usage of the script is unsupported by me, I don't have your setup. See LICENSE for details.

Required dependencies are: Bash, and a Terminal Emulator.
